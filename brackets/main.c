// Algorithm that reads a string and outputs a success message if sting contains a closing brackt for every opening bracket, and the opening and closing bracket types match, strings without brackets also return success message. If there is a mismatch, prints the position of the first unmatched closing brackts, or if there are no unmatched closing brackets the position of the first unmatched opening bracket
